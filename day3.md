# Day 3 Notes

## Keynote

### 5 Reasons to use Angular
* Opinionated
* Trustworthy
* Familiar
* Scaled
* Ecosystem

* Use Angular CLI to move fast
* Use Universal for SEO, Content-first app
* Do not use Universal with legacy backend or Cordova, NativeScript, or Electron

## Readable code
* Write style guide
* 5 seconds rule – if you cannot figure the code out in 5 seconds, you should rewrite
* Most important information should go first – properties, followed by methods
* Less than 20 lines – if the code is longer than 20 lines, refactor!
* Self-describing code rather than explaining context
* Use comments – explain why, consequences, jsdocs for API

## RxJS v6
* Use piepale operators
* New unhandled error behaviors – throws error asynchronously, use errorHandler to handle error
* import only from 'rxjs', 'rxjs/operators'

## Server-side rendering
* Use Angular-element to separate out interactivity off the initial load
