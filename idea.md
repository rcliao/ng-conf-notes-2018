# Ideas

This is where I store some of the inspiration and ideas.

## Use Angular-Elements to create framework component

Angular-elements (soon to be released in Angular v6) allows Angular to build _Angular component_ to _Web Components_. This implies we can build the web components in Angular using its developer tools (e.g. testing, live reload and what not.)

## Swap out the testing libraries to use `jest`

Swap out the usage of `mocha` and `jasmine` to use `jest` over

## Create a workflow for frontend development on top of Angular CLI

To make the front end development more streamlined, we should create
a workflow to build front end applications using CLI.

## Create Angular Canvas Component to write template down to JSP

I need to find someone to ask that knows Angular internal to see if there
is any possibility to create Angular component and compile it down to
JSP

## Actions

* Upgrade internal UI framework to use Angular to build WebComponents
* Implement jest testing for internal UI framework
* Add guidelines for using CLI flow to add component
* Research a way to use Angular to compile component to static file (HTML or JSP) â€“ whether it has a render function or not
